# Quadratic Contribution Guide 

Thank you for considering contributing to the data science spreadsheet :sparkles:

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide, you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started

Make sure you can run Quadratic locally from the source.

1. Install npm, [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), and [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)
2. Run `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

To run the web app: `npm start`

To run the Electron app: `npm run dev`

If you have any problems getting the project to run locally, please create an issue to document the problem. See "Create an issue" below.

### Issues for Feature Requests and Bugs

Quadratic uses GitHub issues to track all feature requests and bugs.

#### Create an issue

If you have a feature request or spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue does not exist, please open a new issue!

When reporting a bug, please provide:

- Issue description
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- What's the expected result?
- What's the actual result?
- Additional details / screenshots

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/quadratichq/quadratic/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. 

#### How to contribute code

1. Fork the repository.

1. Run Quadratic locally. See "Getting Started" above.

1. Create a new working branch and start making your changes!

1. Lint and format your changes using Prettier.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with your changes:

1. Create a pull request.

1. Link your PR to the GitHub Issue [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are working on an Issue.

1. Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.

We review all PRs quickly, so we will give you feedback in short order!
